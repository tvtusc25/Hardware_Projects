-- The alu circuit implements the specified operation on srcA and srcB, putting
-- the result in dest and setting the appropriate condition flags.

-- The opcode meanings are shown in the case statement below

-- condition outputs
-- cr(0) <= '1' if the result of the operation is 0
-- cr(1) <= '1' if there is a 2's complement overflow
-- cr(2) <= '1' if the result of the operation is negative
-- cr(3) <= '1' if the operation generated a carry of '1'

-- Note that the and/or/xor operations are defined on std_logic_vectors, so you
-- may have to convert the srcA and srcB signals to std_logic_vectors, execute
-- the operation, and then convert the result back to an unsigned.  You can do
-- this all within a single expression.

  -- Note that you should always put the carry bit into index 16, even if the
  -- carry is shifted out the right side of the number (into position -1) in
  -- the case of a shift or rotate operation.  This makes it easy to set the
